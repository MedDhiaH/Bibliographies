We bolster the ANES results with a pair of survey experiments where subjects evaluated randomly assigned potential political discussion partners. Our results show that more attractive individuals are viewed as more knowledgeable and more persuasive, and are more likely to be sought out by others for political information. In addition, more attractive individuals (even the relatively uninformed) are more likely to report attempting to persuade others. These findings have implications for our understanding of how citizens identify political experts, the potential for the spread of misinformation, and the political judgments citizens make.}

Second, we proceed beyond a one-dimensional assessment of appearance by simultaneously analyzing attractiveness, competence, and likability, including interactions.

   abstract = {Judges ratings of physical appearance were obtained for 79 candidates who had competed for 21 parliamentary seats during the 1972 Canadian federal election, A comparison was made between the number of votes obtained by attractive and unattractive candidates. As predicted, the results indicate that attractive candidates averaged more votes than unattractive ones (322 ex 11%, p < 0. 001). An unexpected finding was that the politically unpopular parties were represented by physically unattractive candidates. Only a single member of the political fringe groups obtained an appearance score which was above the median for the entire group (p = 0.0001). Several possible causes of the relation between party affiliation and appearance were discussed. The origins of the idea that physically attractive people enjoy more benefits than the less beautiful are perhaps more deeply embedded in folk psychology than in empirical research. The results of several recent studies, however, support this general proposition ( Dion, 1972; Dion, Berscheid, & Walster, 1972; Efran, 1974. These limited findings suggest that attractive people are better liked, arc believed to possess more desirable personalities, and are judged less severely if they commit socially unacceptable acts than are their unattractive counterparts. Nevertheless, there is something unappealing about the idea that appearance may actually be an important determinant of social behaviour and this notion is often regarded as self-evident, unbelievable, and ridiculous, all at the same time. Aronson (1969, p. 160) has noted that social psychologists have preferred to "believe that beauty is only skin deep" and have avoided "investigation of its social impact for fear they might leam otherwise." Politics represents an area of public life in which the effects of appearance may lead to very important social consequences and in which the idea of special privilege for the pretty is particularly repellent. Aside from speculation and anecdotes, there is no evidence that good looks are actually a political asset. This supposition is, however, a common one and has had fleeting acceptance among newsmen and political observers; it seems as if they too suspect that appearance is important but are reluctant to believe that anything that seems so trivial could really be of major and general * Requests for reprints should be sent to: Michael G.

Commenting on the all-important Kennedy-Nixon television debates during the 1960 presidential election, Time (5 September 1969, p. 24) asked rhetorically "Was Nixon sabotaged by TV makeup artists?" Time also noted poll results which suggested that the majority of those who had watched the debates on television believed that Kennedy had emerged as the winner whereas those who had listened to the debates on the radio reached the opposite conclusion. Sorensen (1965, p. 199) made a similar point, noting that Nixon's verbal debate sounded weak and "what was worse, Nixon looked weak . . . his gray suit and heavily powdered jowls looked flabby and pallid beside Kennedy's dark suit and healthy tan . . . Nixon looked drawn and tired." While Sorensen was prepared to comment on the enormous importance of the television debates and on the probable effect of appearance on those debates, he did not actually go on to identify Kennedy's good looks as one of the decisive factors in Kennedy's favour that helped to provide him with the final narrow margin of victory. Nevertheless, a candidate's appearance is one of his most salient attributes and it has often been noted that voters frequently act capriciously enough to permit this variable to have an influence on their decisions. The incredibly low level of awareness of issues which typifies many voters (Campbell, Converse, Miller, & Stokes, 1960) would also favour the operation of this variable. From a psychological perspective it matters little whether attractive candidates benefit from a "what is beautiful is good" stereotype (Dion et al., 1972), or win votes because an evaluative process such as that described by Byrne and his colleagues (Byrne, 1971; Byrne, London, & Reeves, 1968) continues to have influence even at the polls. In cither case the prediction is still that attractive candidates will, on the average, fare better than unattractive ones. The purpose of the study reported here was to discover if the appearance of candidates in a major election actually does influence the outcome of the election. Despite the uncomfortable implications of the hypothesis, it was predicted that attractive candidates would obtain a greater proportion of the vote than unattractive candidates.}

   abstract = {Introduction Do better looking candidates gain more votes in elections? When voters evaluate candidates running for office, they use information cues and heuristics, which may or may not be directly related to politics. Existing research shows that a candidate’s physical appearance—facial attractiveness, in particular—affects not only how voters evaluate the candidate but also the fate of his or her election outcome. Yet, some studies argue that a candidate’s facial expressions, such as smiling, increase his or her votes, while others claim that voters’ impressions of the candidate’s face, such as competent looking, influence their vote choice. Thus, these factors might play more important roles in voting behavior than does candidates’ facial attractiveness.}

Little research, however, has been done to investigate this claim. Here, the authors examine the role that these nonverbal aspects of candidate presentation play in the process of political communication. In the course of two related studies, the impact of candidate photographs appearing on campaign flyers is assessed. The results suggest that these photographs influence voters' perceptions of a candidate and this significantly affects their vote. How a political candidate looks and speaks has a significant impact on that candidate's chances of being elected-style shapes image and image affects the vote. These claims are political truisms of the television era. Election commentary invariably focuses on candidates' images and their image-making strategies. A good example of this is provided by the news commentary on the 1984 Democratic presidential primaries. Attention centered on the role of image-the strength of Gary Hart's image and the weakness of the images of the initially more prominent Alan Cranston and John Glenn. Although the importance of a candidate's appearance and style is taken for granted by politicians, campaign consultants, and news commentators, there is little systematic research to support this assumption. Political scientists have not addressed the issue. In the research reported here, we provide a first step in the study of this nonverbal dimension of political communication and its impact on voter preference. We offer evidence which suggests that (1) a candidate's physical appearance produces a clear image of that candidate's character and fitness for public office and (2) this nonverbally communicated image has a significant impact on the vote.}

We find that beauty significantly affects total household income – via respondents' probability of employment and their hours of work and hourly wage, and whether they have a partner who contributes income to the household. Second, we examine whether the returns to beauty in Australia changed between the 1980s and 2000s. It is found that, for the most part, the effect of beauty was constant across this period. There is, however, some evidence of an increasing effect of beauty on the likelihood that a female respondent is employed, which we suggest may be due to selection effects and the growth in female workforce participation.}

A large part of the existing literature analyses single-member constituencies in parliamentary elections, presidential elections and open lists in proportional representation systems. In contrast, relatively little is known about the effects of the physical attractiveness of front-runners in multiple member constituencies. This paper fills the research gap. Taking the 2004 European Parliament elections as an example, it analyses the influence of front-runners’ physical attractiveness on the electoral success of their respective parties and combined lists. Voter behaviour is captured by real-life election results in the 64 constituencies of the 2004 European Parliament elections. The attractiveness of the front-runners is estimated according to the Truth-of-Consensus Method. Twenty-four students were shown portrait photographs of the candidates and were asked to rate each candidate’s attractiveness. The attractiveness score of a candidate is then computed by averaging the different ratings he or she has received. Multilevel analyses show that front-runners’ attractiveness substantially influences election results.ZusammenfassungFrühere Studien haben bereits auf beeindruckende Weise gezeigt, dass die physische Attraktivität von Politikern ihren Wahlerfolg beeinflusst. Ein Großteil der verfügbaren Arbeiten untersucht dabei Einerwahlkreise bei Parlamentswahlen, Wahlen nach präsidentieller Wahllogik und offene Listen bei proportionalen Verhältniswahlen. Relativ wenig ist hingegen über den Einfluss der physischen Attraktivität von Spitzenkandidaten in Mehrpersonenwahlkreisen bekannt. Dieser Beitrag schließt diese Lücke. Am Beispiel der Wahlen zum Europäischen Parlament 2004 analysiert er den Einfluss der physischen Attraktivität der Spitzenkandidaten auf den Erfolg ihrer jeweiligen Parteien bzw. Listenverbindungen. Das Wahlverhalten wird dabei über die Wahlergebnisse in den 64 Wahlkreisen der Europäischen Parlamentswahl 2004 abgebildet. Die Attraktivität der Spitzenkandidaten wird anhand der Truth of Consensus-Methode approximiert. 24 Studierenden wurden dazu Portraitfotographien der Kandidaten mit der Aufforderung vorgelegt, die Attraktivität der abgebildeten Personen anhand einer Skala zu bewerten. Der Attraktivitätsscore der Kandidaten ist der Durchschnittswert der erreichten Attraktivitätsurteile. Mittels Mehrebenenanalysen wird nachgewiesen, dass die Attraktivität der Spitzenkandidaten substantiell das Wahlergebnis beeinflusst.}

Here we extend these findings by examining the contributions of attractiveness and trustworthiness in male faces to perceived votability. We first use real faces to show that attractiveness and trustworthiness are positively and independently related to perceptions of good leadership (rating study). We then show that computer graphic manipulations of attractiveness and trustworthiness influence choice of leader (Experiments 1 and 2). Finally, we show that changing context from wartime to peacetime can affect which face receives the most votes. Attractive faces were relatively more valued for wartime and trustworthy faces relatively more valued for peacetime (Experiments 1 and 2). This pattern suggests that attractiveness, which may indicate health and fitness, is perceived to be a useful attribute in wartime leaders, whereas trustworthiness, which may indicate prosocial traits, is perceived to be more important during peacetime. Our studies highlight the possible role of facial appearance in voting behaviour and the role of attributions of attractiveness and trust. We also show that there may be no general characteristics of faces that make them perceived as the best choice of leader; leaders may be chosen because of characteristics that are perceived as the best for leaders to possess in particular situations.}

We test this assumption using the unlikely case of Quebec, where provincial elections are highly salient, characterized by a strong cleavage, a sophisticated electorate and strong party- and leader-centeredness. Evaluating the effect of physical attractiveness on vote shares for nearly 5500 candidates in a multivariate analysis for four elections (i.e. 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2018), we find that physical attractiveness plays no role in determining candidates' vote shares. This applies for candidates' attractiveness score, as well as their attractiveness ranking relative to other candidates. For theory, this finding suggests that the effect of attractiveness on candidates’ electoral fortunes in winner takes all systems is contingent on other factors such as the existence of cleavages and the candidate- or party centeredness of the party system.}

Using the German election system that combines first-past-the-post election with party-list proportional representation, our results show that plurality elections provide more scope for translating physical attractiveness into electoral success than proportional representation. Whether political parties strategically use the beauty premium to optimize their electoral objectives is less clear.

Using raters chosen to be representative of the electorate, we assess the beauty of political candidates from major political parties, and then estimate the effect of beauty on voteshare for candidates in the 2004 federal election. Beautiful candidates are indeed more likely to be elected, with a one standard deviation increase in beauty associated with a 1½ - 2 percentage point increase in voteshare. Our results are robust to several specification checks: adding party fixed effects, dropping well-known politicians, using a non-Australian beauty rater, omitting candidates of non-Anglo Saxon appearance, controlling for age, and analyzing the 'beauty gap' between candidates running in the same electorate. The marginal effect of beauty is larger for male candidates than for female candidates, and appears to be approximately linear. Consistent with the theory that returns to beauty reflect discrimination, we find suggestive evidence that beauty matters more in electorates with a higher share of apathetic voters.}

Candidate appearance may be especially important for uninformed voters, as it is easy to observe. Voters may favor good-looking candidates because they expect them to be more competent or persuasive, but it can also be that voters simply enjoy laying their eyes on beautiful politicians. As politicians on the right have been deemed more attractive in Europe, the US, and Australia, the importance of beauty in politics favors conservative parties. A related finding is that voters use beauty as a cue for conservatism.}

   abstract = {Numerous studies document that better-looking candidates win more votes. Yet the causal mechanisms leading to this advantage remain unexplored. We consider for the first time a potential trigger of the looks–vote association that has previously been suggested but not tested in the literature: exposure to campaign posters of the candidates. We test this explanation with German election survey data, which we augment with ratings—provided by MTurk workers from the U.S.—of the attractiveness and facial competence of about 1,000 district candidates. Confirming previous studies on Germany, we find that attractiveness is positively associated with candidate vote share (1.2 ppts. min–max). At the voter level, we find tentative evidence for the idea that the association is moderated by exposure to campaign posters: effects are in the expected directions and their sizes consistent with what we observe at the candidate level, but we cannot always reject the null hypothesis of no effect. In contrast to attractiveness, we do not find conclusive evidence for an effect of facial competence in the election considered. These preliminary results suggest that inundating voters with candidate posters, as in elections in Germany and many other places, might be a reason for voting based on looks.}

Uses a computer-based survey to evaluate subjects’ first impressions of real British candidates from the 2010 general election. Looks at the perception that Conservative candidates and candidates who are relatively young are more attractive. Concludes that attractive candidates were more moderately more successful, even when we control for other important determinants of electoral success. What do British voters look for in their candidates? We know they favour candidates who have experience serving their constituents and those with local ties. As a result, parties often emphasise these characteristics in their campaign materials. However, these materials also provide voters with the candidates’ images. Using a survey where respondents are asked to evaluate real British candidates using only rapidly determined first impressions of facial images, we demonstrate that candidates who were deemed attractive enjoyed greater electoral success in the 2010 general election. Specifically, we find that candidates who are widely perceived to be more attractive had a higher vote share, even when we take into account the candidates’ age, party, incumbency and campaign spending.}

We theorise that formal institutions mediate the positive effect from which attractive candidates benefit. More in detail, we focus on the type of electoral system, hypothesising that physical attractiveness plays a more important role in majoritarian, first-past-the-post systems than in list proportional systems. We test this stipulation using the German federal elections’ two-tier electoral system, together with data collected in Australia on the physical attractiveness of German federal election candidates in 2013. A series of bivariate and multivariate statistics show that physical attractiveness is a significant factor explaining a candidate’s likelihood to win in the FPTP tier, but not in the list proportional representation (PR) tier.}

By examining a set of low-information elections where candidate photographs were displayed on the ballot, we test how first impressions of candidates can influence election outcomes. We find that attractive candidates are more likely to be attributed the qualities associated with successful politicians and these trait inferences, based on facial appearances, influence the outcomes of elections. We also find that these trait inferences are based on physical characteristics of the candidates, such as age, race and ethnicity, evident from a photograph. Therefore, first impressions can be important determinants of election outcomes, especially in low-information elections.}

Almost fifty years of empirical research has shown that ill-informed voters will use the physical attractiveness of candidates, as well as readily-available information on scandal allegations involving candidates running for office, as a heuristic shortcut to determine their voting behaviour. This article represents the first attempt to link the existing literature on the electoral effects of scandals with the existing literature of the electoral impact of candidate attractiveness. Using data on U.S. House of Representatives elections between 1972 and 2012, we find that candidate attractiveness mitigates the negative electoral effects of involvement in scandal; this implies that attractive politicians do get a “break” when involved in scandals. Of all type of scandals, we also find that candidate attractiveness has the largest moderating role if the incumbent is embroiled in a sex scandal.}

   abstract = {We test the effects of physical appearance on electoral outcomes for the 2013 German national elections. We find that a candidate's perceived attractiveness and, to a lesser extent, competence vis-a-vis his or her closest contestant increases the chances of winning a direct mandate, while likability plays a minor role. Additionally, we find the appearance effects to be conditioned by gender, age, and incumbency status. Our study advances existing research in four ways. First, we capture relative differences in appearances, which resembles real-world situations more closely than absolute measures. Second, we proceed beyond a one-dimensional assessment of appearance by simultaneously analyzing attractiveness, competence, and likability, including interactions. Third, the central role of parties in the German mixed electoral system makes an especially tough test for appearance-based effects. Fourth, we use rater response latency to weight our measurement with an assessment of ambivalence.
